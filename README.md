# Puzzle adding and testing
1. New puzzle needs to be added in `src/Puzzle/Year2019/Day1DescriptionOptional/Part1.php` directory
2. Puzzle solution method needs to inherit `App\Puzzle\PuzzleInterface` interface
3. Puzzle can be run from project root using CLI command
```sh
puzzle:run <year> <day> <part> <puzzle_input>
```
e.g.
```sh
php bin/console puzzle:run 2017 1 2 '91212129' 
```  
4. Also you can open puzzle in your favorite browser, e.g.
```
http://localhost/src/Puzzle/Year2017/Day1InverseCaptcha/Part1.php
``` 

# Multiline input
Multiline input can be pasted to CLI using quotes.
Both single quotes and double quotes work.

```sh
php bin/console puzzle:run 2017 2 1 '5 1 9 5
7 5 3
2 4 6 8'
```
